# ActivationFunctions-in-C

[![AK](https://img.shields.io/badge/AK-Made%20by%20AK-success)](https://github.com/ArvindAROO/)

A repository contains some of the activation functions used in ML implemented in C

Activation functions are the functions used in CNN's - a type of Neural Networks for finding out which neuron to fire and which not to.

This repository as of now contains ReLU and Sigmoid functions.

This is implemented in C. Hence 'MinGW' or 'CyGwin' or any other compatible c-compiler must be present.
This also includes graphing which as of now is implemented only for Windows system or Windows sub system for linux

For graphing 'gnuplot' needs to be installed and set as environment variable.

graphing is based on system and terminal control by C. Graphing is 'not' implemented directly. It is implemented by using 'gnuplot'

Hope you all like it
